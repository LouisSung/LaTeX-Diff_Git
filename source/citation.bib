  abstract = { This paper is concerned with the evaluation and tabulation of certain integrals of the type (* 00 I(p, v; A) = J J fa t) ) e~cttxdt. In part I of this paper, a formula is derived for the integrals in terms of an integral of a hypergeometric function. This new integral is evaluated in the particular cases which are of most frequent use in mathematical physics. By means of these results, approximate expansions are obtained for cases in which the ratio b/a is small or in which b~a and is small. In part II, recurrence relations are developed between integrals with integral values of the parameters pt, v and A. Tables are given by means of which 7(0, 0; 1), 7(0, 1; 1), 7(1, 0; 1), 7(1,1; 1), 7(0, 0 ;0), 7(1, 0;'0), 7(0, 1; 0), 7(1, 1; 0), 7(0,1; - 1 ), 7(1,0; - 1 ) and 7(1,1; - 1 ) may be evaluated for 0 \&lt; b/a ^ 2, 0 ^ c/a ^ 2. },

  abstract  = {Eco is a self-contained, ultra-wearable and expandable wireless sensor platform under 1cm<sup>3</sup>. Previous platforms make trade-offs between size or expandability. Eco achieves both with a novel flex-PCB expansion connector for digital/analog I/O, firmware programming, and battery charging. It can be folded up without obstruction or clipped off if expandability is no longer needed. Only 15\% the volume of MICA2D0T, Eco has the same size as the nonexpandable muPart node but with several times more memory, processing and communication speeds. A separate data aggregator and a development/base-station board enable Eco nodes to form a high-performance body sensor network for pre-term infant monitoring and interactive dance},
